A simple and versatil package to programmatically manage your Laravel `.env` files. 

It allows you to read, write, and update environment variables with ease, including support for comments and automatic backups.

> [!WARNING] 
> **Warning:** This package is currently in a **beta stage**. The `main` branch contains the latest beta version. While it aims to be stable, please use it with caution in production environments and ensure you have backups. We appreciate any feedback or bug reports during this phase.

> [!CAUTION]  
> And please note, this package is part of a professional project that needed this feature, and I decided to release it as a Laravel package (in case anyone could benefit from it or find it useful). I've tried to run every possible test to ensure it works. But beyond my own use, I haven't tested it. Despite everything, I'm convinced that all the features work correctly and have their respective tests. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you find a bug, a feature that doesn't work correctly, or have a suggestion, don't hesitate to contact me. I'll try to fix or implement it as soon as I have time. Thanks!

## Features

*   **Read and Parse**: 
    - Accurately reads and parses existing `.env` files directly (in .env format), understanding their structure.
    - It also supports Laravel Collections to manage the .env files, if you prefere.
    
*   **Get Variables**: 
    - Retrieve the value of any environment variable.
    - Option to provide a default value if the key is not found.

*   **Set Variables**: 
    Add new variables or update existing ones.
    - Support for adding/updating inline comments.
    - Support for adding/updating block comments above a variable.

*   **Remove Variables**: 
    - Delete environment variables from the file.

*   **Check Existence**: 
    - Verify if a specific key exists in the `.env` file.

*   **Comment Preservation**: 
    - Intelligently preserves existing inline and block comments when modifying variables.

*   **`export` Prefix Preservation**: 
    - Recognizes and maintains the `export` prefix for variables if present.

*   **Automatic Backups**: 
    - Creates a backup of the `.env` file before any changes are saved.
    - Configurable backup path.
    - Configurable retention policy (number of days to keep backups).
    - **Automatic pruning** of old backups.

*   **Fluent API**: 
    - Chain methods for a more expressive way to manage variables (e.g., `Env::set('KEY', 'value')->save()`).

*   **Facade and Dependency Injection**: 
    - Usable via a convenient `Env` and `EnvCollect` facades or by injecting the `EnvManager` or `EnvCollectManager` class service.

*   **Configuration**: 
    - Publishable configuration file for backup settings.
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that this project has been developed with **Laravel 12** and **PHP 8.3** in mind, so it may not work properly with older versions.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require daguilar/belich-env-manager:dev-master
```

Or in your composer file:

```bash
"daguilar/belich-env-manager": "dev-master"
```

The package will automatically register its service provider. Optionally, you can publish the configuration file using:

```bash 
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Daguilar\BelichEnvManager\BelichEnvManagerServiceProvider" --tag="belich-env-manager-config"
```

This will create a `config/belich-env-manager.php` file in your project where you can customize the backup settings.

## Configuration

After publishing the configuration file, you can find it at `config/belich-env-manager.php`. Available options:

- `backup.enabled`: (bool) Enable or disable automatic backups. Defaults to true.
- `backup.path`: (string) The directory path where backups will be stored. Defaults to `storage_path('app/belich/env_backups')`.
- `backup.retention_days`: (int) The number of days to retain backups. Backups older than this will be pruned. Set to 0 or null to retain forever. 
    - Defaults to 7.

## Usage 

- You can use the Env facade or inject the `Daguilar\BelichEnvManager\Services\EnvManager` class.
- And on the other hand, you can manipulate the .env file from two different approaches:
    1. You can use the .env file directly.
    2. You can use the .env file as a Laravel Collection.

Please, remember this is a **beta version**, use it with the utmost caution.

### 1) Using the .env format (you will directly modify the .env file)

You can manipulate the .env file in its own format, using the `.env format`:

```php 

use Daguilar\BelichEnvManager\Facades\Env;

// Get all the data as .env 
$allTheDataAsEnv = Env::getEnvContent();

///////// Other operations with the ,env file data:

// Get a value
$appName = Env::get('APP_NAME');

// Get a value with a default
$dbHost = Env::get('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1');

// Check if a key exists
if (Env::has('APP_DEBUG')) {
    // ...
}

// Set a value
Env::set('NEW_VARIABLE', 'its_value')->save(); 

// Set a value with an inline comment
Env::set('API_KEY', 'your_api_key_here')->commentLine('This is an important API key')->save();

// Set a value with block comments above
Env::set('MAIL_HOST', 'smtp.example.com')->commentsAbove([
    '# Mail Configuration',
    '# Ensure these are correct for your provider'
])->save();

// Remove a key
Env::remove('OLD_VARIABLE');

// Save changes to the .env file
// This will also trigger a backup if enabled
Env::save();

// Get the entire .env content as a string
$envContent = Env::getEnvContent();
```

### Using multipleSet() for Batch Updates (.env format).

For setting multiple variables  at once with their respective comments, you can use the multipleSet() method for a fluent API:

```php 
use Daguilar\BelichEnvManager\Facades\Env; 

Env::multipleSet()
    ->setItem('BATCH_KEY_1', 'value1')
    ->commentLine('Inline comment for BATCH_KEY_1')
    ->setItem('BATCH_KEY_2', 'value2')
    ->commentsAbove(['# Block comment for BATCH_KEY_2'])
    ->save(); 
```

### Using Dependency Injection (.env format)

```php 
use Daguilar\BelichEnvManager\Services\EnvManager;

class YourService
{
    protected EnvManager $envManager;

    public function __construct(EnvManager $envManager)
    {
        $this->envManager = $envManager;
    }

    public function updateEnv()
    {
        $this->envManager
            ->set('MY_SETTING', 'new_value')
            ->commentLine('Updated via DI')
            ->save();
        
        $currentAppName = $this->envManager->get('APP_NAME');
        // Do something with $currentAppName
    }
}
```

### 2) Using Laravel Collection Format

```php 
$manager = app(EnvCollectionManager::class);

// Get all the collection
$envCollection = $manager->getEnvContent();

// Set an existing value
$manager->set('APP_DEBUG', 'false')
    ->commentLine('Production mode');

// Add new value (if the field does not exist)
$manager->set('NEW_KEY', 'value')
    ->commentsAbove('This is a new setting');

// Remove a value by key
$manager->remove('OLD_KEY');

// Update the file from a collection
$newCollection = collect([...]);
$manager->updateFileFromCollection($newCollection);

// Save the changes
$manager->save();

// Using fluent interface
$manager->set('APP_NAME', 'Laravel')
    ->comment(false)
    ->commentsAbove('Application Name')
    ->commentLine('Do not change')
    ->save();

// And of course, you can use the Facade (EnvCollect)
EnvCollect::get('APP_NAME')
    ->comment(false)
    ->commentLine('Do not change')
    ->save();
```

## Backup Management

Backups are created automatically when Env::save() or EnvManager::save() is called, provided backups are enabled in the configuration. Old backups are pruned according to the `retention_days` setting.

## Testing 

```bash 
composer test
```
